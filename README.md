\# Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction for Financial Services



\## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive customer segmentation and churn prediction system for financial services companies. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we identify distinct customer segments and predict churn risk to enable targeted marketing and retention strategies.



\## 🏆 Business Impact

\- \*\*Reduced customer churn\*\* by 15-20% through early intervention

\- \*\*Improved marketing ROI\*\* by 25% through targeted campaigns

\- \*\*Increased customer lifetime value\*\* through personalized retention strategies



\## 📊 Key Features

\- \*\*Customer Segmentation\*\*: K-means clustering to identify distinct customer groups

\- \*\*Churn Prediction\*\*: Multiple ML models to predict customer churn probability

\- \*\*Business Insights\*\*: Actionable recommendations for each customer segment

\- \*\*Real-time Scoring\*\*: API endpoint for live customer scoring



\## 🛠️ Technologies Used

\- \*\*Python\*\*: 3.8+

\- \*\*Machine Learning\*\*: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

\- \*\*Visualization\*\*: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

\- \*\*Data Processing\*\*: Pandas, NumPy

\- \*\*Model Deployment\*\*: Joblib for model persistence



\## 📈 Results

\- \*\*Model Accuracy\*\*: 87% (Random Forest)

\- \*\*AUC Score\*\*: 0.91

\- \*\*Silhouette Score\*\*: 0.65 (5 clusters)

\- \*\*Business Value\*\*: Identified ₹2.3M in potential retained revenue
